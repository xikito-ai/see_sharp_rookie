*This repository contains a collection of small projects written in C#.*

### Project 1: GuessNumber

Have a user guess a random number between 1-10 and let them know if they got it correct, are too low, or are too high.

### Project 2: PasswordChecker

Have an user input a password and check its strength by a couple of standards. The strength of a password is measured by the score (whose starting value is 0). For each standard met the score is incremented by one. Therefore, the higher the score the stronger the password.
