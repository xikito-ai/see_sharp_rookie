This repository contains a collection of small projects written in C#.

###Project 1: GuessNumber

###Project 2: PasswordChecker

Have an user input a password and check its strength by a couple of standards. The strength of a password is measured by the score (whose starting value is 0). For each standard met the score is incremented by one. Therefore, the higher the score the stronger the password.
